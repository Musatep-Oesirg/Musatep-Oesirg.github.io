        <p>My interest in programming came about when I was 14 years old. My thinking was that if I learned to program at an early age, I could get a job during college as a programmer. The first language I had tried learning was Python, but the process didn't go as well as I had hoped. I watched many long videos on how Python worked, but I could never write a single line of coherent code. Pessimism quickly set in and I disregarded coding for a while. About 2-3 years later, I became interested in ethical hacking (more specifically bug bounties). Many websites offered courses on ethical hacking and I decided to choose Hack The Box. As I read through the content, I found myself puzzled with the terminology used. I once again became pessimistic about the circumstances, however, I didn't give up so easily that time. Many Youtube videos talked about how knowing a programming language gives one a major leg up in hacking. This is because being able to read and script code allows a greater arsenal of abilities as opposed to one without programming knowledge. I then began to learn JavaScript because of it's usefulness in web hacking. Khan Academy was the site I chose because of fond experiences with it. They have an interactive course that requires you to do projects on your own. This was perfect for me because before I didn't know where to start. I have written many projects in JavaScript and now I'm learning HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>Khan Academy has a computer programming course that I would recommend anyone who wants to become a front-end developer. Though I haven't been through the entire course yet, I have reviewed it and can say the content is quality. So far I have learned basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Though my main goal is to learn how to hack, the course provides concepts and terminology that have and will continue to advance my understanding of computer science. JavaScript is probably the most useful tool that I will take away from this experience because of its flexability. Once I begin to get the hang of it, I can use it for both front-end and back-end developing.</p>

        <p>I have an idea for a website that I want to call BlackhatGUI. It is going to be a website that can teach you about IT, hacking, and there will be a black sqaure on the screen that I will test all of my pentests on and everytime I break into it I will patch it and add it to my list of pentests. The teaching part if for people visiting the website, but I mainly just want to use it to build the most protected website I can and learn to hack safely. I think that a hacker GUI would be awesome to have and could make things a lot easier to understand. I know that a ton of hacker tools already have GUIs, but I want to make mine look like on from the movies instead of it being a normal terminal.</p>
